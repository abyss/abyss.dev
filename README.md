# abyss.dev // cwr.io

This is the source code for two websites, https://abyss.dev and https://cwr.io

The websites are built using Hugo Extended, with the [hello-abyss](https://github.com/abyss/hugo-theme-hello-abyss) theme, which is based on the [hello-world-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) by [Djordje Atlialp](https://github.com/rhazdon).

Both are built using the same content, with different environment configurations (changing some of the site to be depersonalized).

Both sites are hosted using GitHub Pages, and are automatically deployed on push using GitHub Actions.
